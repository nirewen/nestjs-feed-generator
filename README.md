# WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a template to make a NestJS application with the ATProto XRPC endpoint for a custom BlueSky feed

Folder structure is the same as for [feed-generator](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator/)

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds)

## Why?

I like NestJS and want to add more API routes without the barebones ExpressJS
